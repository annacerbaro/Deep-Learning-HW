# Deep-Learning-HW
1. From Perceptron to DNNs

From understanding a basic perceptron to creating a feedforward neural network for digit classification in Python and NumPy.


2. Optimize and Train Deep Models

Develop a Deep Neural Network using PyTorch for classification. Address overfitting issues and ensure fair model selection.

3. Convolutional Neural Networks 

Create a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification, focusing on the CIFAR-10 dataset.


4. Recurrent Neural Networks & Transformer

Build Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset. Compare RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs in terms of performance and computational load. Explore bidirectional models and experiment with Transformers for the same task.


5. Autoencoders
   
Develop shallow and deep autoencoders for dimensionality reduction. Experiment with denoising data using autoencoders.


6. Variational Autoencoders
   
Create a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) in PyTorch. Train the model on the MNIST dataset with appropriate hyperparameters, and analyze the learned latent encodings through visualization techniques.
